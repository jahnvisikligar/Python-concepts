## OOP(Object-Oriented programming):
-  ### Class
A class is a collection of objects. It contains blueprints/prototypes from which the objects are being created. It is a logical entity that contains some attributes and methods. A class instance with a defined set of properties is called an object. As a result, the same class can be used to construct as many objects as needed. The '__init__' special method also known as a constructor is used to initialize the 'Class Name' class with attributes. 
note: attributes are names given ti variables contained in a class.
